This is the 2.6 driver. It works under 2.6.9-1.667smp.
At one point it compiled under 2.4, but I never tried it so no promises.



2.6:

First edit the Makefile so that LINUXBUILD points at your built kernel:

LINUXBUILD=/lib/modules/2.6.9-1.667smp/build/

This is where Fedora Core 3 puts it.


type 

make

then as root:

/sbin/insmod si3097.ko  verbose=1 maxever=33554432

or for 4.2

edit Makefile.2.4

change YOUR_RELEASE to the kernel build:

YOUR_RELEASE=/export/jhagen/linux-2.4.32/linux-2.4.32

/sbin/insmod si2097.o


for either:

./cfg will create the /dev entry by reading /proc/si3097


Now the app.

cd apps

make test_app

edit the file Test.cfg to be the cfg file that SI gives you 
for your cameras. This defines the values you see for the I H L 
commands.


./test_app

This lists the simple set of commands.

Try I H and L and view the responses. This tests the uart code.

Try "dma" this tests the dma. By default it sets up an 8000000 byte transfer,
starts the dma, gives a C command and waits till done.
