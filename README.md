### Spectral Instruments 3097 camera interface card driver

This is a linux driver for the Spectral Instruments model 3097
PDCI Fiber Optic Digital Camera Interface and some simple test
utilities.

The 3097 is a 32-bit universal (5V or 3.3V) PCI card which provides
a high speed fiber or copper serial interface to SI cameras.
It can transfer image data at up to 64 MBytes/sec.

### Support

Issues and pull requests welcome.  See also: [project wiki](https://github.com/garlick/si3097/wiki)

Note:  SI does not provide support for this driver.  A Linux SDK can be
obtained from them for a fee.

### Origin and License

The driver and a set of test utilities was originally developed by Jeff Hagen
in 2006.  [His sourceforge repo](http://si3097.cvs.sourceforge.net/) appears to
no longer be maintained, hence the fork here.
