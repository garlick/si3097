Found on Roche FLX+ linux server:

/usr/local/rig/config/3639A.bin
	Camera DSP code file.  Referred to as such from rigParameters.parse script.

/usr/local/rig/config/series800_FFT.cpf
	Similar to .set file.  Probably input to Roche specific software?
	Includes 32 words of "readout" and "config" parameters.

/usr/local/rig/runTime/camParamsConfig.txt
	Simplified/pre-parsed version of above?  Values are different though.
	camParamsInitial.txt and camParamsReadout.txt were identical
